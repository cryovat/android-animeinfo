Anime info app for Android
==========================

This repository contains a prototype for an app for looking up information
about [anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime) series and films. It uses
the [MyAnimeList Unofficial API](http://mal-api.com/) to fetch data.

It was hacked together overnight in march 2011 and subsequently abandoned.
